## **_Installation_**
Here are some guidelines for installing the project on your local machine in order to be able to try it: 

1. Since Node.js applications don't have a front end, clone or download the repository to your own local machine and run it from your command line.

2. Then, make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running ```npm init``` in your command line.

3. Run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` in order to download all the dependencies. Make sure to also download Inquirer.js by entering ```npm install inquirer``` in your terminal in the root directory of the project. Learn more about this package on [npm documentation.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

4. Run ```node index.js``` or ```node index``` in your terminal to launch the application, the first question will appear in your terminal. 

5. To make sure the Jest tests work, run ```npm run test``` and inspect what the CLI returns.

6. Enjoy and don't hesitate to contribute! ðŸ™‚
